Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project aims to classify the images in the given dataset as cats or dogs using convolutional neural networks(CNN)

Approach and pipeline:
Refer to the report and code for the approach and implementation.

Results:
Results after training 18,000 images of cats and dogs:

number of epochs = 15
training data / validation data split = 80/20
MODEL
CONV 3x3 filter layers with batch norm - 32 x 64 x 96 x 96 x 64
Dense layers with drop out of 0.2 and 0.3 - 256 x 128 x 2
loss: 0.0638
accuracy: 0.9759
val_loss: 0.3255
val_accuracy: 0.9044
The model was tested on the images in the test1 folder. The performance of the model was very good and was able to predict the animals with 97-99% accuracy.
